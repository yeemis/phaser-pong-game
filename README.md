# phaser-pong-game

Using Phaser and Javascript to make a simple pong game!


## How to pull code
You should have a codespaces.new link provided to you by your trainer. Use that and press 'Create codespace' to start coding

Alternatively, if you would like to progress from this page, 
1. Click on 'Codespaces' in the left toolbar
2. Click on the green button labelleed 'New codespace' at the top-right corner of GitHub 
3. Select 'tinkercademy/phaser-pong-game' as your repository
4. Ensure that Branch is 'main', Region is 'Southeast Asia' and Machine type is '2-core' (very highly recommended but not compulsory)

## Stopping and Deleting your Codespace
When you have a codespace, you will be using up your free quotas for your Codespaces core hours (usage hours) and GB-month (storage).   

To prevent the wastage of core hours, make sure to stop your codespace from running when not in use. (e.g. before going for a meal)  
To prevent the wastage of storage, delete your codespace when not in use (e.g. at the end of the course)

To stop your codespace from running:
1. Click on the search bar at the top of your codespace (NOT the Google search bar!) OR type Ctrl + P
2. Key in '>Codespaces: Stop Current Codespace'
3. You might need to choose the Codespace you would like to stop
4. Click on it, and wait for a few seconds until you see 'Codespace is stopped'


To delete your codespace (Only delete at the end of the course):
1. Click on 'Codespaces' in your left toolbar
2. Click on the 3 dots on the right of your codespace
3. Click on 'Delete Codespace'

## Free plan
In your free plan, each user would have 120.00 usage hours and 15.00 GB-month per month.  
By using a 2-core Machine, each hour spent would use up 2 core hours, translating into 60 hours of usage per month.  
Do spend your hours and storage wisely!
